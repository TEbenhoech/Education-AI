This project uses a behavior tree to implement the basic logic behind an instructor teaching a class, and then asking for questions.
Students can be in one of three states, have a question, have no question, and getting question answered. This is shown by the student either being red, green, or blue respectively.

The teacher is either lecturing or answering questions. While answering questions he adresses them in the order the students had the question (raised their hand).
Future work is making the teacher move to the student before answering the question, and coverting the HCSM used in UniVRsity into a behavior tree.

A large problem I had come across while making this was the creation of the behavior tree strcuture. Originally I had wanted to create the tree myself, 
but after looking at many resources, this became more difficult than I had anticipated. I instead found a free asset that had most of a binary tree implemented, and used the asset to create the AI.
